# Document QA Bot (RAG-based)

A question-answering bot that provides accurate, grounded answers based **only on a specific set of documents**.  
The system uses embeddings, a vector database, and a Large Language Model (LLM) to retrieve relevant document chunks and generate answers.

This is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system with a conversational interface.
